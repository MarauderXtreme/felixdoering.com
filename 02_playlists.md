From time to time I am putting together some titles into playlists. It helps me to connect themes with different feelings.  
And I want to share them with you!  
This playlists are made in cooperation with <a href="https://kepler.international" target="_blank">Christoph</a> who created the Spotify versions for me.  
Have a look at our cooperative project <a href="https://github.com/MarauderXtreme/video-game-radiostation-playlists" target="_blank">Video Game Radiostation Playlists</a>

For more information about the lists themself click onto the images.
