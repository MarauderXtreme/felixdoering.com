[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/h4llow3En/AGDSN_traffic_Mac.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/h4llow3En/AGDSN_traffic_Mac) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4llow3En/AGDSN_traffic_Mac/master/LICENSE)
A simple application for your Mac menubar which shows the remaining traffic or used percentage.

There is only support for Wundstraße/Zellescher Weg at the moment. But more are coming soon!

When the used traffic exceeds 3 GiB a notification will be fired if it is activated in settings.

Runs on OS X 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite.
